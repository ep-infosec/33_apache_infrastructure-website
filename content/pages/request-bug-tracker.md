Title: Requesting an issue and feature-request tracker for a project

The ASF recommends these options for tracking issues and feature requests:

* <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira" target="_blank">Jira</a>
* The <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/" target="_blank">GitHub issue tracking feature</a>
  
Infra itself uses Jira, so to request a Jira instance for your project, create a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA" target="_blank">Jira ticket</a> with the necessary details:

### Requesting a Jira instance ###

File a Jira ticket with INFRA using the link above, and set the issue type to `New Jira Project`. Supply at least the following information:

  - A list of committers with access to modify/close tickets
  - A list of committers who will act as Jira administrators
  - A notification scheme (to which email address do JIRA notifications go?)
  - A name and description for the Jira instance
  
### Response ###

Infra will respond within a couple of days, either with a request for clarification of some point or to let you know that the instance is set up and ready for your project to use.
