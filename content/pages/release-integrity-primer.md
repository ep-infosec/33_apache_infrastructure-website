title: Handling Release Artifact Integrity Errors at the ASF


This page will help you resolve [release distribution policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution) errors that our [Download Integrity Checker](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-download-integrity-checker) discovers.
Each reported error has an accompanying error code (`CHKxx`). The code will help you resolve issues by using the matrix below:


| Error Code | Error Description | How to Address the Issue |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| `CHK01`    | Key used for signing artifact is missing from the [`KEYS`](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#key-basics) file | Make sure the key that signed the release was expected. <br/>Update your [`KEYS`](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#key-basics) file to include the key. Remember to move your updated `KEYS` file from `/dev/` to `/release/` on dist.apache.org when releasing with new keys. |
| `CHK02`    | Weak or missing checksum file(s) | <ul><li>If the release artifact has a valid signature, generate a [conforming checksum](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#sha-checksum) and add it. You can leave the old hash file.</li><li>Otherwise, see `CHK05`.</li></ul> |
| `CHK03`    | No [`KEYS`](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#key-basics) file was found in the project's distribution directory | Make sure the project directory has at least one KEYS file containing all signing keys used for distribution. Projects may have more than one [`KEYS`](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#key-basics) file (per-component, per-version, etc.) but they *MUST* be called `KEYS` and exist within the project's dist directory. |
| `CHK04`    | The signature used for signing expired before signing the file | <ul><li>Itâ€™s possible the expiry has been changed. Make sure the [`KEYS`](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#key-basics) file is updated.</li><li>If the key has really expired treat the file as if it has no signature (`CHK05`). |
| `CHK05`    | No (or invalid) signature found for the release artifact | Check: <ul><li>Is there a signature file for this artifact?:<ul><li>If the signature is valid but has the wrong file name or extension, rename it to the appropriate .asc file name.</li><li>If the signature is invalid, see [handling invalid or missing signatures](#invalid-sig).</li></ul></li><li>If there is no signature file at all, see [handling invalid or missing signatures](#invalid-sig). |
| `CHK06`    | Checksum mismatch | Try to spot what the problem was (why are you generating the wrong checksum?): <ul><li>If the file has a valid signature (no `CHK04` or `CHK05` errors for this file), generate a [conforming checksum](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#sha-checksum), add it, and remove the broken one.</li><li>Otherwise: treat as if `CHK05`.</li></ul> |

## <a id="invalid-sig">Handling invalid or missing signatures</a>
In case of an invalid or missing signature for a release artifact, the project MUST choose one of the following actions:
 - Remove the artifact(s)
 - Re-assert that the artifact is valid, sign and upload the correct .asc signature file (and fix any missing/invalid checksum files)
 
 In either case, the project MUST inform the ASF Infrastructure and Security Team 
 at `private@infra.apache.org` and `security@apache.org` of their action, with clear evidence that the action 
 has been discussed and agreed upon (a link to a lists.apache.org thread will suffice).

If you have questions about the error reports, this page, or our release distribution polices in general, 
feel free to reach out to us at `users@infra.apache.org`.
