Today, the Infrastructure Team took the step to disable public signups to ASF Jira

This was not done lightly. The main reason for this is the amount of spam and spam accounts that are created every day, it has
made managing Jira a big effort. In addition, Infra are planning with Atlassian to move to their Cloud service, where account
limitations apply; and our current self hosted instance is around 150000 users above the limit required for migration.

Daily spam account creations undermine our efforts to reduce the user counts and so we must stop the creation of the spam
accounts themselves, not just the spam issues/comments created from them.

Projects have for a long time wanted a resolution to the spam problems that plague their Jira Projects, often these spam issues
and comments go unnoticed, and the added attraction to spammers is that all issues get copied to mailing list archives.

From now on, until such a time as we migrate to Atlassian Cloud, we ask that Projects themselves take on the task of creating
the Jira account requests that come in. Projects are encouraged but not required to create a dedicated private mailing list where
users can email to ask for an account.

Once an account has been created, that user is then automatically whitelisted to create issues anywhere within our Jira instance.

We appreciate that this is not as convenient as having public signups on, but we must do this in order to move forward and to
stop the spam in its entirety.

Any questions or concerns please feel free to email users@infra.apache.org

Kind Regards

The ASF Infrastructure Team
