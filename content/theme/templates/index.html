        <hr/>
          <p><b>December 5, 2002</b>: The first meeting of the <b>Infra Roundtable</b> takes place Wednesday, December 7. Learn more about the Roundtable, and how to take part, <a href="https://infra.apache.org/roundtable.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
          <p><b>November 11, 2022</b>: The Infra team has disabled public signups to the ASF Jira service. The rationale and implications are <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/jira-public-signup-disabled" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <p>On <b>August  9, 2022</b> Infra cut over the production LDAP servers to new virtual machines. LDAP configuration (ACLs, etc.) have not changed, but the certificates have. Replacing the ancient, self-signed certificate, Letsencrypt provisions the certificate on the new servers. Please contact Infra if you have any questions about this change.</p>
          <p><b>July 13, 2022:</b> On July 12 an essential part of the Apache email infrastructure failed, interrupting mail delivery throughout the Foundation. The service is active again after a seven-hour outage, as the Infrastructure team accelerated plans to migrate all email services to <b>mailgw</b>, as noted below. A fuller report is available on <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/email-service-interruption-and-restoration" target="_blank">our blog</a>.</p> 
          <p><b>June 15, 2022:</b> As part of the Apache Infrastructure team's goals of modernization and service improvement, we are pleased to announce the general availability of "mailgw", the long-awaited replacement for the venerable Hermes FreeBSD mailing list server. See our <a href="https://infra.apache.org/mail-migration-faq.html" target="_blank">mail migration FAQ</a> for further details.</p>          
          <p><b>April, 2022:</b> Infra's April Fool's prank, the <b>interactive voice response service</b>, is still available to explore and enjoy at <b>1-717-7-APACHE</b> (1-717-727-2243).</p>
          <p><b>January, 2022:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>The ASF has decomissioned the venerable FreeBSD host, minotaur.apache.org. The primary functions of this host have long since moved to <i>people.apache.org</i>, also known as <i>home.apache.org</i>.</li>
              <li> Infra has enabled 2FA (two-factor authentication support on oauth.apache.org (used for sites such as lists.apache.org and cveprocess.apache.org, etc). You can couple a Google Authenticator or other TOTP (Time-based One Time Password apps) to your login process for added security. To enable 2FA, click the <b>2FA</b> link next time you have to use oauth.apache.org for a login.</li>
              <li> ci.apache.org - Buildbot 0.8 has been turned off. The DNS now points to ci2.apache.org, its 3.2 replacement.</li>
              <li> The CMS has been turned off. All projects have moved their websites to a different publishing method.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
